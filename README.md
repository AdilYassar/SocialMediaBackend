Social Media App - Assessment Test
This project is a Social Media App built as part of an assessment test. Below is an overview of the application's structure, features, and how to set it up.

Key Features
Authentication

Sign-Up/Login: Users register with their name, email, and password.

Token-Based Authentication: Tokens are generated upon registration and login. Each token is associated with a unique user ID.

Middleware ensures secure handling of tokens for all protected routes.

Posts

Create Posts: Users can create posts with text and an optional image. Images are handled as base64 strings and stored in the backend.

Feed Logic: The feed displays all posts, including:

Text content

Images (if provided)

Authorâ€™s name

Like and comment counts

Interactions:

Users can like or comment on posts.

Profile

Displays the logged-in user's profile and their posts.

Tech Stack
Frontend: Built with React Native

Backend: Node.js with Express.js

Database: MongoDB

Project Structure

Images:

Images are uploaded as base64 strings and stored in this format.

Supports efficient retrieval and display.

Authentication Middleware: Ensures all protected routes are secured with token-based validation.
